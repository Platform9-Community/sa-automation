cephClusterSpec:
  network:
    connections:
      # Whether to encrypt the data in transit across the wire to prevent eavesdropping the data on the network.
      # The default is false. When encryption is enabled, all communication between clients and Ceph daemons, or between Ceph daemons will be encrypted.
      # When encryption is not enabled, clients still establish a strong initial authentication and data integrity is still validated with a crc check.
      # IMPORTANT: Encryption requires the 5.11 kernel for the latest nbd and cephfs drivers. Alternatively for testing only,
      # you can set the "mounter: rbd-nbd" in the rbd storage class, or "mounter: fuse" in the cephfs storage class.
      # The nbd and fuse drivers are *not* recommended in production since restarting the csi driver pod will disconnect the volumes.
      encryption:
        enabled: false
      # Whether to compress the data in transit across the wire. The default is false.
      # Requires Ceph Quincy (v17) or newer. Also see the kernel requirements above for encryption.
      compression:
        enabled: false
      # Whether to require communication over msgr2. If true, the msgr v1 port (6789) will be disabled
      # and clients will be required to connect to the Ceph cluster with the v2 port (3300).
      # Requires a kernel that supports msgr v2 (kernel 5.11 or CentOS 8.4 or newer).
      requireMsgr2: false
  #   # enable host networking
  #   provider: host
  #   # EXPERIMENTAL: enable the Multus network provider
  #   provider: multus
